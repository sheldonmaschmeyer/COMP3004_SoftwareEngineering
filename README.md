# COMP3004_SoftwareEngineering

COMP3004 Software Engineering Group project is private, to respect the professor's need to prevent other students from cheating on similar projects. Each year, slightly different theme but same overall concepts. If interested in looking at the project, please ask or message me directly. This course I took twice. Both times, my team members were happy with the work I did. The first time I had to explain and justify my design choice. This was easier the second time as I learned how to improve the readability of the code. The first attempt, I missed a few morning classes due to working till midnight at Shoppers DrugMart. The first attempt, the project was excellent but, did poorly on midterm and by 1% I failed the final exam. The second attempt, I ensured I did better on the midterm and final exam. The second time I took the course, to ensure that I graduated, I quit my job and concentrated on my studies. After graduating, to continue paying rent, I returned to Shoppers DrugMart until I find career employment. Previous courses by the same professor were (unofficial) VOD, which I greatly appreciated, for any missed classes. This course, due to the group project, was not VOD recorded, despite the lectures being regular lectures.
